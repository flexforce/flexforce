                    <p class="card-text">Flex Force has formed Agile and SAFe Agile SCRUM teams that can be deployed into your inflight development work as extensions of your own development organization.  They have training and experience in the latest development tools, DSO and methodologies and they know the AT&T environment so their ramp up time will be minimal.   Assignments can run 12-36 months.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Occasionally, we all are challenged to pull a team together to get an application upgrade done or initiative like CDP onboarding underway that are over and above our inflight commitments.  Flex Force can pull the resources together to help you deliver on those commitments.  We can provide small and large teams of single type resources like x number of Java developers or multiple fully staffed SCRUM teams to get you over the hurdle. These assignments are typically less than a year.</p>

<div>
    <!-- <h2>The Concept</h2> -->
    <p>The concept of Chunk of Work originated with the Flex Force Israeli team and has been incorporated into the US based Flex Force team.  We work with our clients to design, development and deliver a standalone application, tool, or functionality.  A good example of what we can do is with our end-to-end support of UDAS, a mission critical application that is part of the merger integration of UVerse & DTV onto a common platform and billing system.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Transitioned out 90+ contractors that had owned 100% of the support (in 4 months - annual savings of $7M)</li>
        <li>Formed 6 Scrum Teams of about 50 employees (2 teams in the US & 4 teams in Tel Aviv) that partner to coordinate 24x7 application maintenance</li>
        <li>Ownership of the delivery of new DTV features and the conversion of 13 million customers from DTV billing to the unified billing platform (RC1)</li>
        <li>Delivery every 4 weeks, including features that will save $36M annually (Complimentary Channel support)</li>
        <li>Improved speed to market by migrating to ECO, CDP and MicroServices</li>
        <li>We have the skills and people to do it all</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each Chunk of Work is unique to our clients but we also bring our tool kit of re-usable components that help speed the effort.  We recently built XXXX and incorporated our test automation tools.</p>
    <p>Letâ€™s talk about what you want to accomplish.</p>

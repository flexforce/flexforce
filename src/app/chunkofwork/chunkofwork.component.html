                    <p class="card-text">A good example of what we can do is with our end-to-end support of UDAS, a mission critical application that is part of the merger integration of UVerse & DTV onto a common platform and billing system.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transitioned out 90+ contractors that had owned 100% of the support (in 4 months - annual savings of $7M)</li>
                            <li>Formed 6 Scrum Teams of about 50 employees (2 teams in the US & 4 teams in Tel Aviv) that partner to coordinate 24x7 application maintenance</li>
                            <li>Ownership of the delivery of new DTV features and the conversion of 13 million customers from DTV billing to the unified billing platform (RC1)</li>
                            <li>Delivery every 4 weeks, including features that will save $36M annually (Complimentary Channel support)</li>
                            <li>Improved speed to market by migrating to ECO, CDP and MicroServices</li>
                            
                        </ul>

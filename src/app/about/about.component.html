    <h2>Our Successes</h2>
    <p>It’s easy to talk in general about the new Flex Force, but here are some of our recent successes that demonstrate where Flex Force is heading and how we make an impact for our Business Partners.</p>

    <h3>DirecTV Work Flow Engine Coaching and Scoring Tool</h3>
    <p>Just recently, one of the Flex Force Innovation Squads worked with DTV on a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a scoring tool.  The Work Flow Engine Coaching and Scoring Tool DTV POC delivered data insights to managers, increasing care agent conformance with the Work Flow Engine (WFE). The targeted coaching that the trial enabled resulted in a 4% decrease in dispatches, 1% reduction in repeat calls, and lowered average call handle times by over 1 minute. The application, if implemented, is estimated to realize $30M in savings in its first full year.</p>

    <h3>UDAS Chunk of Work End-to-End Application Support</h3>
    <p>Our end-to-end support of UDAS is a perfect example of Flex Force adapting to the needs of the business. Not only are we responsible for 24x7 application maintenance of this mission critical application, we also do all enhancing development and DevSecOps migration work. And we took over all these responsibilities from 90+ contractors and now manage the workload with 50 AT&T employees on 6 DSO Scrum Teams across 2 continents, at about half the labor cost.</p>

    <h3>DSO SWAT Team</h3>
    <p>As leaders in DevSecOps Transformation, Flex Force was tasked to assist in the migration of applications to the core DevSecOps platforms of ECO, CDP and MicroServices. Focusing on Automation of these migrations, Flex Force has automated xx process that reduce the labor effort significantly, to the tune of $13M so far.</p>
